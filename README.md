### Hi there 👋

I am a self-taught QA Engineer from Spain.

Something about me: 

- 📖 I’m currently learning Kotlin and communication skills
- 🥰 Love testing activities (analyzing requirements, risks, incidents, create test strategy and test plans, explore...)
- 🔍 Curious about new technologies

- ⚡ Fun fact: My username "godzyta" is related with the film Godzilla 🦖
